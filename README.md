# Regression Test

## v2

Any time you modify an implementation within PaddlePaddle Book, you should also do regression testing.

```bash
/bin/bash ./v2/run_regtest.sh book_image_name book_image_tag
```

`book_image_name` is a docker image name of PaddlePaddle Book and `book_image_tag` is an image tag of that.
